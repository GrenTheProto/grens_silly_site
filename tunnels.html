            <p>The Tunnels are a pocket dimention created by Gren to contain the Mimics, keeping them trapped inside the ever shifting maze. The Mimics make it a dangerous place and it's layout shifting nature can make navigation difficult. There are side room scattered throughout the Tunnels, where supplies can be found. Killing mimics is the best way to get food there. If you find OM, who looks a lot like Gren, he'll try to help you stay safe, just be careful due to his mental unstability.</p>
